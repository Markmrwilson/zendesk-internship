Run the program by opening a command prompt at the .jar file's location, then typing
java -jar zendesk.jar

The program displays the tickets from my Zendesk account, from least recent to most recent.
To look at a certain page, type "page [number]" (e.g. page 1)
To look at a certain ticket, type "inspect [number]" (e.g. inspect 22)
To exit, type "exit".

If the program can't download the tickets, it will display an error and exit. 
Please make sure you're connected to the internet and then try again.

Thanks!
